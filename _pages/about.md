Hi there! 

Welcome to my website!
My name is **Thang Phan Chau**. I am currently an AI Resident in [AI Center @ FPT Software](https://fpt-aicenter.com/) from Mar 2024,
advised by [Dr. Nghi Bui](https://bdqnghi.github.io/). I earned my bachelor's degree in Data Science from the University of Information Technology, where I was advised by [Dr. Kiet Van Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=v3RSwOkAAAAJ&hl=en) while working on NLP for Vietnamese. During my undergraduate years, I focused on Vietnamese NLP and introduced [VisoBert](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.315/), a compact yet powerful model for processing Vietnamese social media text. 

Currently, my research explores LLMs's **reasoning** and Multi-agent system abilities, particularly in coding tasks. Looking ahead, I aim to enhance LLMs, making them both stronger and more efficient.
